This is repo for my simple PHP/MySQL-based CMS.
It's not a feature-rich CMS and if you want a "download-click-profit" solution,
PlasticBox is not for you, sorry.

I develop this software in my spare time, so please don't expect from me fast
and very productive development.
This framework is intended to help me in setting up simple web shops and
it will be great if someone else will find this code useful.

If you have any questions, want to join, etc. -
email me at auwerk@gmail.com. You can write to me in english, 
or in russian (my native language).

Thanks for your interest!
Alexander.
